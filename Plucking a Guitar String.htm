<h2><b>Background</b></h2>

<p>
For this assignment, you will write a program to simulate plucking a guitar string using
the <em>Karplus-Strong</em> algorithm. This algorithm played a seminal
role in the emergence of physically modeled sound synthesis (in which 
a physical description of a musical instrument is used to synthesize
sound electronically).
</p>


<p>
When a guitar string is plucked, the string vibrates and creates
sound.  The length of the string determines its <em>fundamental
frequency</em> of vibration.  We model a guitar string by sampling
its <em>displacement</em> (a real number between -1/2 and +1/2)
at <em>N</em> equally spaced points (in time), where <em>N</em> equals
the <em>sampling rate</em> (44,100) divided by the fundamental
frequency (rounding the quotient <em>up</em> to the nearest integer).

<p>
<!--
A guitar-player can shorten the vibrating portion of a string by pressing
the string against one of the frets.
The guitar vibrates at a different frequency, depending on this length.
-->


</p><ul>
<li><em>Plucking the string.</em>
The excitation of the string can contain energy at any frequency.
We simulate the excitation with <em>white noise</em>:
set each of the <em>N</em> displacements
to a random real number between -1/2 and +1/2.
<!-- This represents the "initial harmonic transients found in the attack of a real guitar." -->


<p>
</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>


</p><p></p></li><li><em>The resulting vibrations.</em>
After the string is plucked, the string vibrates.
The pluck causes a displacement which spreads wave-like over time.
The Karplus-Strong algorithm simulates this vibration by maintaining
a <em>ring buffer</em> of the <em>N</em> samples: the algorithm
repeatedly deletes the first sample from the buffer 
and adds to the end of the buffer the average of the first two samples,
scaled by an <em>energy decay factor</em> of 0.994.


<p>
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Plucking a Guitar String_files/karplus-strong.png" alt="the Karplus-Strong update">
</blockquote>
<p>

</p></li></ul>

<p><b>Why it works?</b>
The two primary components that make the Karplus-Strong algorithm
work are the ring buffer feedback mechanism and the averaging operation.

</p><ul>
<li><em>The ring buffer feedback mechanism.</em>
The ring buffer models the medium (a string tied down at both ends)
in which the energy travels back and forth.
The length of the ring buffer determines the fundamental frequency
of the resulting sound.  Sonically, the feedback  
mechanism reinforces only the fundamental frequency and its  
harmonics (frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental).  The  
energy decay factor (.994 in this case)
models the slight dissipation in energy as the wave makes a  
roundtrip through the string.</li>

<p></p><li><em>The averaging operation.</em>
The averaging operation serves as a gentle <em>low-pass filter</em>
(which removes higher frequencies while allowing lower frequencies to pass,
hence the name).  Because it is in the path of the  
feedback, this has the effect of gradually attenuating the higher  
harmonics while keeping the lower ones, which corresponds closely with  
how a plucked guitar string sounds.</li>

<p></p><li><em>Some intuition.</em> A more intuitive, but somewhat less
    precise explanation of the alogirhtm is the following.  When you
    pluck a guitar string, the middle of the string bounces up and
    down wildly.  Over time, the tension on the string causes the
    string to move more regularly and more gently until it finally
    comes to rest.  High frequency strings have greater tension, which
    causes them to vibrate faster, but also to come to rest more
    quickly.  Low frequency strings are looser, and vibrate longer.
    If you think about the values in the ring buffer as positions over
    time of a point in the middle of a string, filling the buffer with
    random values is equivalent to the string bouncing wildly (the
    pluck).  Averaging neighboring samples brings them closer
    together, which means the changes between neighboring samples
    becoming smaller and more regular.  The decay factor reduces the
    overall amount the point moves, so that it eventually comes to
    rest.  The final kicker is the ring buffer length.  Low notes have
    lower frequencies, and hence longer ring buffers
    (44,100&nbsp;/&nbsp;<em>N</em> is bigger if <em>N</em> is smaller).
    That means it you will have to go through more random samples
    before getting to the first round of averaged samples, and so on.
    The result is it will take more steps for the values in the buffer
    to become regular and to die out, modeling the longer
    reverberation time of a low string.
</li></ul>

From a mathematical physics viewpoint, the Karplus-Strong algorithm approximately solves
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">1D wave equation</a>,
which describes the transverse motion of the string as a function of time.

<!--
At a high level, the Karplus-Strong algorithm approximately solves
the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">1D wave equation</a>,
which describes the motion of the string as a function of time.
The wave shape spreads out over time.
The vibration gradually eliminates those frequencies introduced by the
pluck that don't match the string's fundamental frequency of the string,
with the higher frequencies decaying faster than the lower ones.
Eventually, the wave shape will be sinusoidal with frequency equal
to the string's fundamental frequency.
The Karplus-Strong averaging formula is an extremely simplified
method that results in a similar effect, though it remains a bit
of a mystery even to experts.
-->
<!-- The energy decay factor models the friction at the string end points. -->

</p><h2><b></b></h2><b>
Your first task is to create a data type to model the ring buffer.
Write a class named <tt>RingBuffer</tt> that implements the following API:

<blockquote><pre>public class RingBuffer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        RingBuffer(int capacity)  // create an empty ring buffer, with given max capacity
    int size()                    // return number of items currently in the buffer
boolean isEmpty()                 // is the buffer empty (size equals zero)?
boolean isFull()                  // is the buffer full  (size equals capacity)?
   void enqueue(double x)         // add item x to the end
 double dequeue()                 // delete and return item from the front
 double peek()                    // return (but do not delete) item from the front
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<p></p><li>
The design of your program should look like the provided
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/13sp/hw/hw07/RingBuffer.java">RingBuffer.java</a>,
except that you will need to fill in all of the constructors and methods.

<p></p></li><li>
Since the ring buffer has a known maximum capacity from the argument to the constructor,
you must implement it using a <tt>double</tt> array of that length.
Your constructor for <tt>RingBuffer</tt> will need to allocate and initialize this array using <tt>new</tt>. Observe that you have to do this in the constructor (and not when you declare the instance variables)
since otherwise you wouldn't know how big to make the array.

<p></p></li><li>
The instance variables are defined as follows:
<blockquote><pre>public class RingBuffer {
    private double[] rb;          // items in the bufer
    private int first;            // rb[first]  = first item in the buffer
    private int last;             // rb[last-1] = last  item in the buffer
    private int size;             // current number of items in the buffer
}
</pre></blockquote>


<p></p></li><li>
<b>Cyclic wrap-around</b>: For efficiency, your RingBuffer must wrap
around in the array. To do this, maintain one integer instance
variable <tt>first</tt> that stores the index of the least recently
inserted item; maintain a second integer instance
variable <tt>last</tt> that stores the index one beyond the most
recently inserted item.  To insert an item, put it at
index <tt>last</tt> and increment <tt>last</tt>.  To remove an item,
take it from index <tt>first</tt> and increment <tt>first</tt>. When
either index equals <tt>capacity</tt>, make it wrap-around by changing
the index to <tt>0</tt>. Keep in mind, the size of the RingBuffer is
not the same as the size of the array. To get an accurate count of the
number of elements in your RingBuffer, increment the instance variable
size each time you call enqueue() and decrement it each time you call
dequeue(). Here is a demonstration of how the enqueue() and dequeue()
methods work:

<ul>
  <p></p><li><b>Initial State:</b> 
	<blockquote>
	  <img src="./Plucking a Guitar String_files/first-array.png" alt="Initial buffer">
	</blockquote>

  </li><li><b>enqueue(0.5)</b> 
	<blockquote>
	  <img src="./Plucking a Guitar String_files/enqueue-1.png" alt="enqueue-1">
	</blockquote>

  <p></p></li><li><b>enqueue(0.1)</b> 
      <p>
	</p><blockquote>
	  <img src="./Plucking a Guitar String_files/enqueue-2.png" alt="enqueue-2">
	</blockquote>

  <p></p></li><li><b>dequeue()</b> 
      <p>
	</p><blockquote>
	  <img src="./Plucking a Guitar String_files/dequeue.png" alt="dequeue">
	</blockquote>


</li></ul>


<p></p></li><li>
<p>Implement <tt>RingBuffer</tt> to throw an exception if the client
attempts to <tt>dequeue()</tt> from an empty buffer
or <tt>enqueue()</tt> into a full buffer. This will cause your program
to crash and print a stack trace that will help you identify the bug.
(We have included these statements in the skeleton code for you.)  The
following is an example of how to throw an exception:

</p><blockquote>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tbody><tr><td><pre>  if (isEmpty())
    throw new RuntimeException("The ring buffer is empty.");
</pre></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

See <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/33design/Vector.java.html">Vector.java</a>
for some other examples and p. 446 in the book for a slighty expanded
explanation of exceptions..

<p></p></li><li> After you fill in the methods for <tt>RingBuffer</tt>, make
sure to test it using the given test code in <tt>main()</tt>within the
RingBuffer skeleton code <strong>before moving on</strong>. It
enqueues the numbers 1 through N,and then repeatedly dequeues the
first two, and enqueues their sum.

<blockquote><pre>% <b>java RingBuffer 10</b>
Size after wrap-around is 10
55.0


% <b>java RingBuffer 100</b>
Size after wrap-around is 100
5050.0
</pre></blockquote>


</li></ul>

<h2><b>Part II: GuitarString</b></h2>
Next, create a data type to model a vibrating guitar string.
Write a class named <tt>GuitarString</tt> that implements the following API:
  
<blockquote><pre>public class GuitarString
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       GuitarString(double frequency)  // create a guitar string of the given frequency, using a sampling rate of 44,100
       GuitarString(double[] init)     // create a guitar string whose size and initial values are given by the array
  void pluck()                         // set the buffer to white noise
  void tic()                           // advance the simulation one time step
double sample()                        // return the current sample
   int time()                          // return number of tics
</pre></blockquote>


<ul>

<p></p><li>
Start the guitar string class with <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/13sp/hw/hw07/GuitarString.java">GuitarString.java</a>.It contains one of the private instance variables that you will need, and all of the constructors and methods ready to be filled in.


<p></p></li><li><em>Constructors.</em>
There are two ways to create a <tt>GuitarString</tt> object.

<ul>

<p></p><li> The first constructor creates a <tt>RingBuffer</tt> of the
desired capacity <em>N</em> (<the em="">sampling rate 44,100 divided
by <em>frequency</em>, rounded <em>up</em> to the nearest integer),
and initializes it to represent a guitar string at rest by enqueueing
<em>N</em> zeros.

<p></p></the></li><li>
The second constructor creates a <tt>RingBuffer</tt> of capacity equal
to the size of the array, and initializes the 
contents of the buffer to the values in the array.
On this assignment, its main purpose is for debugging and grading.

</li></ul>

<p></p></li><li><em>Pluck.</em> Replace all <em>N</em> items in the ring buffer with 
<em>N</em> random values between -0.5 and +0.5. To implement this, use a combination of the RingBuffer methods size(), dequeue(), and enqueue() to replace the buffer with values between -0.5 and 0.5.

<p></p></li><li><em>Tic.</em> Apply the Karplus-Strong update: delete the sample at the 
front of the ring buffer and add to the end of the ring buffer the average of the first 
two samples, multiplied by the energy decay factor (look above). To implement this, use a combination of enqueue(), dequeue(), and peek().

<p></p></li><li><em>Sample.</em> Return the value of the item at the front of the ring buffer. Use peek() to implement this.


<p></p></li><li><em>Time.</em> Return the total number of times <tt>tic()</tt> was called.

<p></p></li><li><b>Are you getting a NullPointerException? </b> Check the line number provided in the stack trace. An object you are using in this line has not been initialized correctly, and thus has the value of "null". Attempting to access variables or call functions on a null object will throw a NullPointerException.

<p></p></li><li>Once you have filled in all the methods and constructors, make
sure to test it using the given test code in <tt>main()</tt>within the
GuitarString skeleton code <strong>before moving on</strong>.

<p><b>Interactive guitar player.</b>
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/13sp/hw/hw07/GuitarHeroLite.java">GuitarHeroLite.java</a>
is a sample <tt>GuitarString</tt> client
that plays the guitar in real-time, using the
keyboard to input notes. When the user types the lowercase
letter <tt>'a'</tt> or <tt>'c'</tt>, the program plucks the
corresponding string. Since the combined result of several sound waves
is the superposition of the individual sound waves, we play the 
sum of all string samples. After you've completed <tt>RingBuffer</tt> and <tt>GuitarString</tt>,
run <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt> in order to check to see if everything works properly. You should hear
two different pitches corresponding to A and C everytime you press the key.

<h2><b>Part III: GuitarHero</b></h2>

Write a program <tt>GuitarHero</tt> that is similar
to <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt>, but supports a total of 37 notes on the
chromatic scale from 110Hz to 880Hz. In general, make
the <em>i</em>'th character of the string below play the <em>i</em>'th
note.

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Note: </b> <i>i</i> is 0 indexed. For example, <i>i</i>=2 refers to <tt>w</tt>.
  The <em>i</em>th character of the string corresponds to a frequency of 440 × 2<sup>(<em>i</em> - 24) / 
  12</sup>, so that the character <tt>'q'</tt> is 110Hz,  <tt>'i'</tt> is 220Hz,
  <tt>'v'</tt> is 440Hz, and  <tt>' '</tt> is 880Hz.
  </li>
</ul> 

This keyboard arrangement imitates a piano keyboard:

<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>

<p>
<b>I get an <tt>ArrayOutOfBounds</tt> or <tt>NullPointerException</tt> error
in <tt>RingBuffer</tt>. What could cause this?</b>
Does your constructor correctly initialize all of the instance variables?
Did you allocate memory for your array?
Did you inadvertently redeclare an instance variable
in a method or constructor, thereby shadowing the instance variable with the
same name?
</p>

<p>
<b>How do I round a <tt>double</tt> to the nearest <tt>int</tt>?</b>
See the <tt>toGray()</tt> method in
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/31datatype/Luminance.java.html">Luminance.java</a>
(Program 3.1.3).

</p><p><b>
What happens if I call <tt>StdAudio.play(x)</tt> where <tt>x</tt> is
greater than 1 or less than -1?</b>
The value is <em>clipped</em>—it is replaced by the value 1.0 or -1.0,
respectively.
</p>

<p>
<b>I get a <tt>Ring buffer underflow</tt> error in <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt>
before I type any keystrokes. Why?</b>
Did you forget to initialize the ring buffer to contain <tt>N</tt> zeros
in your <tt>GuitarString</tt> constructor?
</p>

<p>
<b>When I run <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt> for the first time, I hear no sound. What am 
I doing wrong?</b> 
Make sure you have tested with the <tt>main()</tt> provided for <tt>GuitarString</tt>.
If that works, it is likely something wrong with <tt>pluck()</tt> since 
the <tt>main()</tt> provided for <tt>GuitarString</tt> does not test that
method. To diagnose the problem, print out the values of <tt>sample()</tt>
and check that they become nonzero after you type <em>lower case</em>
characters <tt>'a'</tt> and <tt>'c'</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b>When I run <tt>GuitarHeroLite</tt>, I hear static (either just one click, 
and then silence or continual static). What am I doing wrong?
</b>
It's likely that <tt>pluck()</tt> is working, but <tt>tic()</tt> is 
not. The best test is to run the <tt>main()</tt> provided for <tt>GuitarString</tt>.
</p>

<p>
<b>How do I use <tt>keyboard.indexOf(key)</tt>?</b>
If <tt>keyboard</tt> is a <tt>String</tt> and <tt>key</tt> is a character,
then <tt>keyboard.indexOf(key)</tt> return the integer index of the first occurrence
of the character <tt>key</tt> in the string <tt>keyboard</tt> (or -1 if it does
not occur).
</p>

<p><b>Should I hardwire the constants 44,100, 110.0, 440.0, 880.0, and 37 in my program?</b>
No, in general, we will deduct if you use an unnamed constant (such as 37)
in your program more than once.
We recommend using the name <tt>SAMPLING_RATE</tt> for 44,100
and <tt>CONCERT_A</tt> for 440.
But you need not name all of the constants in the formula 2<sup>(<em>i</em> - 24) / 12.
</sup></p>

<p><b>Do I need to follow the prescribed API?</b>
Yes, we will be testing the methods in the API directly.
If your method has a different signature or does not behave as specified,
you will lose a substantial number of points.
You may not add public methods or instance variables to the API;
however, you may add private methods (which are only accessible in the
class in which they are declared).  You may also add private instance
variables for data that must be shared between methods.
</p>

<p></p><h2><b>Extra credit 1.</b></h2>
Write a program <tt>GuitarHeroVisualizer.java</tt>
(by modifying <tt>GuitarHero.java</tt>)
that plots the sound wave in real-time, as the user is playing the
keyboard guitar. The output should look something like this, but
change over time.

</blockquote>

You should not redraw the wave on every sample.  Instead, draw the
wave of the last <i>n</i> samples every <i>n</i> timesteps for an
appropriate value of <i>n</i>.  Experiment with different values
of <i>n</i> to find one that you think looks good and draws smoothly.
There is more than one way to handle the drawing — there is not
a "right" way to do this.  You may also do a different visualization,

<p></p><h2><b>Extra credit 2.</b></h2>
Bring your laptop to recitation and perform a piece for your classmates.


<p></p><h2><b>Challenge for the bored.</b></h2>  Modify the Karplus-Strong
algorithm to synthesize a different instrument.  Consider changing the
excitation of the string (from white-noise to something more
structured) or changing the averaging formula (from the average of the
first two samples to a more complicated rule) or anything else you
might imagine.  This is a challenge for the bored, so you will not
receive extra credit for it.  But you may use it as the basis for you
visualizer and/or your performance in class.

Alexander Strong suggests a few simple variants you can try:
<ul>
  <li><em>Stretched tuning:</em> The frequency formula in the
    assignment uses "perfect tuning" the doesn't sound equally good in
    every key.  Instead, most musicians use stretched tuning that
    equalizes the distortions across all keys.  To get stretched
    tuning, using the
    formula <em>f</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;×&nbsp;1.05956<sup><em>i</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;24</sup>.
    Try experimenting a bit with the base of the exponent to see what
    sounds best.</li>
  <li><em>Extra notes:</em> Add additional keys to your keyboard
    string to play additional notes (higher or lower).  Higher notes
    especially will benefit from stretched tuning.  You will need to
    update the 24 in your frequency formula to change the frequency of
    the lowest note.</li>
  <li><em>Better decay factors:</em> Make the decay factor dependent
    on the string frequency.  Lower notes should have a higher decay
    factor; higher notes should have a smaller decay.  Try different
    formulas and see what sounds best.</li>
  <li><em>Harp strings:</em> Flipping the sign of the new value before
    enqueing it in <tt>tick()</tt> will change the sound from
    guitar-like to harp-like.  You may want to play with the decay
    factors and note frequencies to improve the realism.</li>
  <li><em>Drums:</em> Randomly flipping (with probability 0.5) the
    sign of the new value before enqueing it in <tt>tick()</tt> will
    produce a drum sound.  You will need lower frequencies for the
    drums than for the guitar and harp, and will want to use a decay
    factor of 1.0 (no decay).  The note frequencies for the drums
    should also be spaced further apart.</li>
  <li><em>Mix and match:</em> Assign some keyboard keys to drums,
    others to guitar, and still others to harp (or any other
    instruments you invent) so you can play an ensemble.</li>
</ul>
